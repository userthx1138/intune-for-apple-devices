The following pages give high level level directions for setting up Intune with basic Mac management capabilities.

It is assumed that you are already familiar with Intune and have existing Intune and Apple Business Manager instances set up and have logins with sufficient privilege to carry out the operations required.

In **Apple Business Manager** a Managed Apple ID with either the **Administrator** or **Device Enrolment Manager** role is required to add an MDM.
To add a Location and assign the apps and books either the **Content Manager** role or the the **Administrator** role is required.

In Intune sign in as a member of the *Global Administrator* or *Intune Service Administrator* Entra ID roles
